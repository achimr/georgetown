Please hand in your report by April 30th 11:59pm

The task for homework 6 is to use the sample sentences you chose for
homework 1 and translate them with the interactive translation
prediction tool [Lilt](https://lilt.com).

### Preparing the source data and signing up for Lilt (20 points)

1.  Copy and paste each of the source sentences you used in HW1 to a
    text file with one sentence per line and save the file in UTF-8
    encoding. Try not to look at the Microsoft machine translations and
    your edited English translation in order to not influence your
    translating.
2.  Sign up for a 14-day trial of [Lilt](https://lilt.com) using your
    Georgetown Google account
3.  If your source language was Japanese: please contact [Lilt
    support](https://lilt.com/kb/contact) and ask them to enable
    Japanese for your account
4.  Create a new project in Lilt and upload your source text. Make sure
    that on import you are indeed getting 20 segments, if not, use the
    [segment editing tool](https://lilt.com/kb/editor/split-merge) to
    ensure one sentence per segment.

### Interactive Translation Prediction (20 sentences at 3 points each = 60 points)

Without looking at the machine translations and edited translations from
HW1 use Lilt to create translations for each of the 20 sentences. Make
sure that your look at the results from [Quality
Assurance](https://lilt.com/kb/editor/qa) and address the issues raised
by it (if appropriate).

In your report include the following data and analysis:

1.  The source text
2.  The target text created with Lilt (your final edited translation)
3.  The target text you created in HW1
4.  An analysis of the differences between 2. and 3. Point out any
    errorsÂ you notice during analysis in either of the translation
    (referring to the MQM categories, if possible). Please clearly
    identify which translation you are referring to. Of course both
    translations can be different and still completely
    correct/appropriate.
5.  Your judgement which translation you prefer: Lilt (2.), PEMT (3.) or
    \"No preference\"

### Summary (20 points)

Provide a summary of your impressions of translating with Lilt vs.
post-editing the machine translation manually in HW1 (keeping in mind
that we didn\'t use any CAT tool in HW1). Did using the interactive
translation prediction tool allow you to produce better translations?
Why? Where you more efficient? Why? Provide some pros and cons for
either approach. How could research into machine translation help to
improve either post-editing or interactive translation prediction? Is
there maybe a third approach that could help humans work with MT to
produce high-quality translations?
