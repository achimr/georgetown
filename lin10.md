How are you going to build a machine translation system unless you know at
least a little bit about language? You will be required to give 
a short presentation (~10 minutes) on a particular language, 
e.g., Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Hindi, Italian, or Maltese.

You should prepare three to six slides for your presentation, covering
language facts (demographics, location, etc.) important linguistic 
characteristics (orthography, morphology, syntax) and computational efforts 
such as resources, tools, papers. For instance,  how many entries are there
about the language in the [MT Archive](http://www.mt-archive.info/) 
and what are they generally about? Be creative and have fun. 
Asking for help from native speakers or language experts is great.
But you are ultimately responsible for the presentation.
