HW1: Examining the Quality of Machine Translation
=================================================

The first homework assignment does not involve any programming. Instead, you will take a closer look at the quality of todays's machine translation systems.

Translate a Web Page with Microsoft Translator
==============================================

1. Pick a foreign language (preferable one that you have some understanding of - or an easy one like French or Spanish); pick a language that is supported as a [neural MT language in Microsoft Translator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/languages.aspx): under the heading *Microsoft Translator supported languages* select *Neural Translation*
2. Find a news site that publishes news stories in that language. You can also look at Wikipedia articles, if you prefer that.
3. Pick a web page to translate, select 20 or more sentences and translate them with [Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/neural/)

Analyze the Translations
========================

Write a report about the quality of the machine translation.

Go over at least 20 sentences, manually correct each sentence, and report for each sentence:

1. the source sentence
2. the statistical machine translation
3. the neural machine translation
4. a correction of the machine translation
5. an assessment of the error(s) in the statistical machine translation
6. an assessment of the error(s) in the neural machine translation
7. whether you picked the statistical or neural translation as the better one

You may do steps 5. and 6. in any way you want. For instance, you could classify errors as "reordering errors", "word sense error for a noun", or any other type of error you can think of. If you want to, you can classify the errors using [Multidimensional Quality Metrics](http://www.qt21.eu/quality-metrics/).

For instance:

1. _Erst drei Tage ist der neue Ministerpr√§sident Griechenlands im Amt._
2. _Only after three days is the new Prime Minister of Greece in the Office._
3. _It is only three days that the new prime Minister of Greece is in office._
4. _The new Prime Minister of Greece has been in office for only three days._
5. Error assessment of the statistical machine translation
	(1) The translation says that the minister is in office _after_ three days, however the source describes the minister being in office since three days (MQM accuracy/mistranslation error) 
	(2) addition of determiner _the_ in front of _Office_ (MQM accuracy/addition error) 
	(3) the word _Office_ is upper case (an MQM fluency/spelling error) 
	(4) The constituent order, while correct English is awkward. (MQM style error)
6. Error assessment of the statistical machine translation
	(1) The word _prime_ is lower case (an MQM fluency/spelling error)
7. neural

Include in your report a summary of your impression of the major quality problems in the machine translation system that you analyzed.

What to Hand in
