Examining the Quality of Machine Translation
============================================

The first homework assignment does not involve any programming. Instead, you will take a closer look at the quality of todays's machine translation systems.

Translate a Web Page with Google Translate
==========================================

1. Pick a foreign language (preferable one that you have some understanding of - or an easy one like French or Spanish)
2. Find a news site that publishes news stories in that language. You can also look at Wikipedia articles, if you prefer that.
3. Pick a web page to translate and enter it in [[Google Translate -> https://translate.google.com/]]

Analyse the Translations
========================

Write a report about the quality of the machine translation.

Go over at least 20 sentences, manually correct each sentence, and report for each sentence:
1. the source sentence
2. the machine translation
3. a correction of the machine translation
4. an assessment what the error in the machine translation

You may do step 4 in any way you want. For instance, you could classify errors as "reordering errors", "word sense error for a noun", or any other type of error you can think of.

Conclude your report with a summary of your impression of the major quality problems in the machine translation system that you analysed.

What to Hand in
===============

Turn in a written report (on paper or by email to phi@jhu.edu) by the beginning of class on Thursday, February 5.
